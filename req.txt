ðŸ”¹ Proposed Routes
Route	Purpose
/	Home / intro / navigation to gear planner
/gear-planner	Main interactive page to build your setup
/gear/:slot	(Optional) Focused page for managing one gear slot
/my-setups	View and load previously saved gear setups
/about	Project description or how-to-use page (like a help guide)

Why this works:
Home shows routing/navigation (and optionally, auth later)

Gear planner is your main feature (core form + interactivity)

Saved setups gives you a chance to:

Use useEffect to load from localStorage or a JSON mock

Use useContext or props to restore the saved gear

About is a quick way to add one more clean route (bonus points for UX)

You can even add a route like /gear/:slot if you want to:

Use useParams from React Router

Show per-slot management (not required but neat if you're exploring)

ðŸ§  React Concepts This Structure Lets You Show Off
Concept	How Itâ€™s Used
useState	Gear selection, form inputs
useEffect	Load gear options, saved setups
useContext	Share gear planner state across components/pages
Routing	Navigation between views, dynamic routing (/gear/:slot)
Forms	Select gear, save/load setups
External UI Lib	Use MUI AppBar, Drawer, Selects, Cards, etc.

ðŸ§ª Optional (If You Have Time)
Add a "Favorites" feature (like the recipe app), saving preferred gear setups

Allow naming and saving setups (like "Melee Bossing Set", "Skilling Set")
